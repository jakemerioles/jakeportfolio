		<h2> Hi! </h2>
		<p>Hi, I'm Jake Merioles and thank you for visiting my website! I am currently a sophomore at Sunny Hills High School and I enjoy everything that I am doing at the moment.</p>
		<br>
		<p>I'm a person who loves to design. I see the world in a creative way and I want to strive to leave my mark in society. Painting and web designing are some of my favorite things to do during my free time, and I'm always trying to evolve my skills in these areas. I hope to make a difference in the world through my passions and interests.</p>
		<br>
		<p>In addition to designing, I also have a passion for architecture. The way buildings are made always interests me and I love the process that goes into designing the looks of a building along with its functionalities. I am enrolled in engineering classes at SHHS but study architecture on my own. I attended the 2021 SkillsUSA Architectural Design Competition and achieved a gold in the regional competition. This achievement inspires me to pursue what the topic of architecture offers, along with any other passions I have in order to make a difference in the world.</p>
		<br>
		<p>I designed this website to celebrate all my achievements that I have earned throughout my high school life so far, and I hope to be employed in something big in the near future. So much has happened since I turned into a freshman and I wanted to demonstrate what I do in a creative fashion, like this website, to prove that I am a well-rounded individual who is always trying to achieve a great future.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The 2021 TuffyHacks Hackathon was a huge step in my hobby of web developing. This event was a really fun experience and I got to meet three students from Cal State Fullerton, in addition to meeting coders in other teams. We didn't win anything but I won an individual contest called the "Tuffy-Tracing Challenge," and it turns out I won! Below is what I painted—the elephant is missing the ear but it's okay!</p>
